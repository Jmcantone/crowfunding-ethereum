# crowfunding-ethereum

# How to run
1. Use this solution or clone/download to your local workplace.
2. Download the latest Node.js, Ganache (Truffle Suite) and Visual Studio Code.
3. Open a command prompt and run ``ganache-cli``. Here you have a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.
4. Go to the crowfunding-ethereum folder, open a new command prompt there and run the next commands:
- ``npm install``
- ``truffle build``
- ``truffle migrate --reset``
